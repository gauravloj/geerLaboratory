1. OAuth :
    - It is an authorization tool not authentication tool
    - It is a framework that defines how two services can interact
    - It leaves many things undefined to provide the ability to grow
2. Authentication : Verifies 'who are you'
3. Authorization : Decides 'what can you do'
4. OpenID Connect :
    - OAuth 2.0 extension with functions and forms to user profile information
    - Special case of OAuth designed for Single Sign On process and share profile information
    - It uses JWT tokens
5. Other extensions of OAuth:
    - JWT : Json Web Token
    - Token revocation 
    - Token introspection
    - Dynamic client registration
    - Authorization server metadata discovery
6. Tokens : 
    - JWT and Opaque tokens
    - Validate JWT token :
        - Access token separated by two dots '.'
        - Each part is Base64 encoded string
        - First part is header that contains information about hash algorithm and keys used
        - Second part is payload : it contains user defined information. Common fields are 
            - 'iss' : Issuer
            - 'aud' : Audiance
            - 'exp' : expiration time
            - 'cid' : client id
        - Third part is signature : It is generated using publick key and first two part of JWT 
        - Any change in header or payload will change the signature thereby invalidating it
    - Refresh token : Opaque token Used to request access token
    - ID token : JWT token specific to OIDC
        - Peofile scope
        - email scope
        - address scope
        - phone scope
