1. Authorization code : 
    - Client request access to a resource from resource server
    - Resource server redirects the request to Authorization server
    - Authorization server sends Auth Code back to Client
    - Client uses Authorization code to request Access token from resource server
    - To get to access token, Client ID and Client secret are required along with Auth code
2. Authorization code flow : For mobile apps
    - PKCE : proof key for code exchange
    - Client generate code verifier : a URL safe string stored locally on client system
    - Client will generate code challenge using the verifier: Base64 encoded SHA256 hash of verifier
    - Client will send code challenge along with auth request
    - Auth server sends the auth code if Authorization is successfull
    - Now when the client request for access token using Auth code, it will send verifier as well
    - Authorization server will use verifier to generate the code challenge and it will match it with previously received challenge
    - If the generated code challenge matches the previously received challenge, then access token is granted
    - Eg. appauth.io libraries from OIDC
